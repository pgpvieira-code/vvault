//! Embedded name dictionaries for the identity generator.
//!
//! Each `.txt` file contains one name per line and is embedded into the binary via
//! `include_str!`. Languages are keyed by a two-letter ISO 639-1 code (case-insensitive).
//!
//! Adding or updating a language is a Rust-only change: drop the `.txt` files in a
//! `<code>/` subdirectory and register the language below. Unknown codes fall back
//! to English.
//!
//! Two dictionary layouts are supported:
//! - Flat: `firstnames_male.txt`, `firstnames_female.txt`, `lastnames.txt`.
//! - Decade-based: first names are split per birth decade
//!   (e.g. `firstnames_male_1980_1989.txt`), so generated first names match names
//!   that were popular around the generated birth year. Used by de, it and ro.
