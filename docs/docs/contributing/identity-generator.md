# Identity Generator Translations

In VelixVault, when creating a new credential, VelixVault automatically generates realistic alias identities including:
- First names (male and female)
- Last names (surnames)
- Email addresses
- Birthdate

The VelixVault identity generator uses lists (dictionaries) of possible names. Currently, VelixVault has name lists for the following languages:

- 🇩🇰 **Danish** (da)
- 🇬🇧 **English** (en)
- 🇫🇷 **French** (fr)
- 🇩🇪 **German** (de)
- 🇮🇹 **Italian** (it)
- 🇳🇱 **Dutch** (nl)
- 🇮🇷 **Persian/Farsi** (fa)
- 🇷🇴 **Romanian** (ro)
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish** (es)
- 🇸🇪 **Swedish** (sv)
- 🇵🇰 **Urdu** (ur)

**Your language not listed?** Help us add it!

## How to Contribute

We need **lists of common first and last names** used in your language/region. Technical skills are not required. For each language that VelixVault supports, we need a text file with one name per line:

### Basic name lists
1. **Male** first names (100+ names)
2. **Female** first names (100+ names)
3. Common last names/**surnames** (100+ names)

### History specific name lists
VelixVault also supports history specific first names (per decade). In many countries and regions, name popularity has changed throughout the years. Names that used to be popular for people born in the 1950's are barely given to people born in the 1990's and vice versa.

## How to Submit Your Names

1. **Create simple text files** with one name per line:
   - `firstnames_male.txt`
      - optionally: `firstnames_male_1950_1960.txt`, `firstnames_male_1960_1970.txt` etc.
   - `firstnames_female.txt`
      - optionally: `firstnames_female_1950_1960.txt`, `firstnames_female_1960_1970.txt` etc.
   - `lastnames.txt`

2. **Send the files to us:**
   - **Discord**: Join our [community server](https://discord.gg/DsaXMTEtpF) and share in #translations or via private message
   - **Email**: [support@aliasvault.com](mailto:support@aliasvault.com)
   - **Crowdin**: If you're already a member of the VelixVault Crowdin project, send a PM with an attachment

After we have received the files, we'll take care of the technical formatting and making it available in the VelixVault apps.

## Tips

### Name Selection
- ✅ **Use common, popular names** - Names you'd actually encounter in daily life
- ✅ **Modern and traditional** - Include a mix of classic and contemporary names
- ✅ **Diverse styles** - Represent different regional variations within your language

The more names = the more variety and more realistic identities!
