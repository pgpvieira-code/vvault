# Browser extensions
VVault offers browser extensions compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. This guide explains how to build and debug the extensions locally.

## Development Setup
The browser extensions are built using:
- React: https://react.dev/
- WXT: https://wxt.dev/ (A framework for cross-browser extension development)
- Vite: https://vitejs.dev/

### Install dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your host machine, then install the dependencies:

```bash
cd apps/browser-extension
npm install
```

### Development Mode
WXT provides a development mode that automatically reloads changes and opens a new browser window with the extension loaded:

```bash
# For Google Chrome development
npm run dev:chrome

# For Firefox development
npm run dev:firefox

# For Microsoft Edge development
npm run dev:edge
```

## Building and Loading the Extensions Manually

### Google Chrome

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:chrome
```

2. Load in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
   - Click "Load unpacked" and the folder `./apps/browser-extension/dist/chrome-mv3`

### Firefox

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:firefox
```

2. Load in Firefox:
   - Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Navigate to the `./apps/browser-extension/dist/firefox-mv2` folder and select the `manifest.json` file

### Microsoft Edge

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:edge
```

2. Load in Edge:
   - Open Edge and navigate to `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
   - Click "Load unpacked" and the folder `./apps/browser-extension/dist/edge-mv3`

### Safari

1. Build the extension:
```bash
npm run build:safari
```

2. Open the Xcode project in the `safari-xcode/VVault.xcodeproj` folder and build / run the app.

3. The extension will be installed automatically in Safari. Follow the on-screen MacOS app instructions to complete the installation.

## Automatic tests
The extension has two suites of automatic tests that run on every pull request: unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### Unit tests
The unit tests live in the `__tests__` directories scattered throughout the browser extension codebase and run in isolation (no API or browser required). They're powered by [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

```bash
# Run the full unit test suite
npm run test
```

### End-to-end tests
The E2E tests live in `tests/e2e/` and use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to drive a real Chrome build of the extension. Unlike the unit tests, **they require a local VVault API to be running**, since the tests create a test user and exercise the full login/autofill flow against it.

1. Start the dev API locally first (see [Development setup](development-setup.md#running-the-apps)):

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh db-start
./scripts/dev.sh api
```

2. Run the E2E suite. This builds the Chrome extension into `dist/chrome-mv3` and runs Playwright against it:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:build
```

If you've already built the extension and just want to re-run the specs (or a single one), call Playwright directly:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- <spec-name>
```

## Manual tests
In order to test for client side issues, here is a list of public websites that have caused issues in the past and can be used to test whether the extension is (still) working correctly.

### Websites that have caused issues
The following websites have been known to cause issues in the past (but should be fixed now). After making changes to the extension, you can test whether the extension is (still) working correctly by using the websites below.

| Website | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| [Paprika Shopping](https://www.paprika-shopping.nl/nieuwsbrief/newsletter-register-landing.html) | Popup CSS style conflicts |
| [Bloshing](https://bloshing.com/inschrijven-nieuwsbrief) | Popup CSS style conflicts |
| [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/user) | Popup buttons not working |
| [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/login?goto=news) | Popup and client favicon not showing due to SVG format |
| [Bitwarden](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/login) | Autofill password not detected (input not long enough), manually typing in works |
| [Microsoft Online](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) | Password gets reset after autofill |
| [ING Bank](https://mijn.ing.nl/login/) | Autofill doesn't detect input fields and VVault autofill icon placement is off |
| [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pgpvieira-code/vvault/issues) | The "New issue -> Blank Issue" title field causes the autofill to trigger because of a parent form (outside of the role=modal div) |
| [Netim](https://www.netim.com/direct/) | Autofill popup not showing up |
| [ChatGPT login](https://auth.openai.com/log-in) | Autofill popup not showing up |
| TrueNAS (self-hosted login page) | Some characters in password field are inserted double. E.g. `abcde` in VVault becomes `abbccdee` in password field. |
