# Server & web app

The VelixVault server (the API, the Admin app and the web app/client) is built entirely with [.NET 10](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Blazor WebAssembly](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/).

You can open the .NET solution in [Visual Studio 2026+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and work on it like any other .NET project.

## Running it locally

The recommended way to run the server apps from source is via `./scripts/dev.sh`, which starts each app on a consistent set of ports. See the [Development setup](development-setup.md#running-the-apps) guide for the full workflow:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh db-start   # start the dev database
./scripts/dev.sh api        # the API
./scripts/dev.sh client     # the Blazor WASM web app
./scripts/dev.sh admin      # the Admin app
```

You can also run or debug any of these projects directly from your IDE; run `./scripts/dev.sh ports` to see which ports each one expects.
