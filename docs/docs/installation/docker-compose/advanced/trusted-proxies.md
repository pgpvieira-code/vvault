# Trusted proxies

When VVault sits behind another reverse proxy (HAProxy, Traefik, Cloudflare, an upstream nginx, etc.), the built-in nginx reads the real client IP from the `X-Forwarded-For` header so that audit logs and the IP allowlist see the actual client rather than the upstream proxy.

To prevent header spoofing, nginx only honors `X-Forwarded-For` when the request comes from an explicitly trusted upstream. The `TRUSTED_PROXIES` environment variable controls that list.

## How it works

For every incoming request, nginx checks the direct peer's IP against `TRUSTED_PROXIES`:

- If the peer IP matches a trusted entry, nginx replaces `$remote_addr` with the value from `X-Forwarded-For`.
- If it doesn't match, the header is ignored and the direct peer IP is used.

`real_ip_recursive` is enabled, so when a chain of trusted proxies is configured nginx walks the `X-Forwarded-For` list right-to-left until it finds the first untrusted address.

## Options

Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` in the `environment:` section of your `docker-compose.yml` to one of:

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| _empty_ (default) | Trust all RFC1918 ranges (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`). |
| Comma-separated list of CIDRs/IPs | Trust only the listed proxies. **Recommended** when you know your upstream proxy address(es). |
| `none` | Trust no upstream proxies. `X-Forwarded-For` is always ignored and the direct peer IP is logged. |

### Examples

```yaml
# ...
    environment:
      # Trust only a specific HAProxy at 10.0.1.5 and a /24 of internal proxies:
      TRUSTED_PROXIES: "10.0.1.5,192.168.10.0/24"
# ...
```

```yaml
# ...
    environment:
      # Disable X-Forwarded-For handling entirely:
      TRUSTED_PROXIES: "none"
# ...
```

## Apply the change

After updating `docker-compose.yml`, the container must be recreated for the new environment value to take effect:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Why narrow this down

The default of all RFC1918 ranges is convenient. Most setups place VVault and its upstream proxy in the same private network. But it does mean that **any** request originating from a private IP can spoof `X-Forwarded-For` and appear in the logs as a different client. If you have other workloads on the same private network, set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to your specific upstream proxy address(es) so only that proxy is trusted to set the header.
