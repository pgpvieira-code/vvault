# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues and troubleshooting steps for VVault encountered during installation, updates or general maintenance.

---

## Check Docker Container Status

For any issues you might encounter, the first step is to check the Docker container health. This will give you a quick insight into the status of the container which will help you identify the root cause of the issue.

**1. Check the Docker container running status:**

```bash
docker compose ps
```

**2. Check the Docker container logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs
```

**3. Try restarting the Docker container:**

```bash
docker compose restart
```

## Check VVault Text Logs

All VVault services log information and errors to text files. These files are located in the `logs` directory within your VVault installation folder.

**View logs for a specific service:**

```bash
cat logs/[service-name].txt
```

**View PostgreSQL logs:**

```bash
cat logs/postgres/postgres.log
```

If PostgreSQL failed during initialization, also check:

```bash
cat logs/postgres/initdb.log
```

## Common Issues

Below are some common issues you might encounter and how to troubleshoot them.

### 1. PostgreSQL fails to start

**Symptoms:**
- Container fails to start or keeps restarting
- Error messages about database connection failures
- Services unable to connect to the database

**Steps:**

1. Check the PostgreSQL logs for error details:
```bash
cat logs/postgres/postgres.log
```

2. If PostgreSQL failed during initialization, check the init logs:
```bash
cat logs/postgres/initdb.log
```

3. **Permission errors:** If you see permission-related errors, ensure the `database` folder has correct permissions for the user running the Docker container.

4. **Corrupted database:** If the database appears corrupted, you may need to reinitialize it. **Warning:** This will delete all data:

```bash
# Stop containers first
docker compose down

# Remove the postgres data directory
sudo rm -rf database/postgres/

# Restart containers (will reinitialize the database)
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. No emails being received

**Symptoms:**
- Aliases not receiving any emails
- Emails to aliases bounce or timeout

**Steps:**

1. Verify DNS records are correctly configured
2. Ensure ports 25 and 587 are accessible from the internet
3. Check your server's firewall settings
4. Verify that your ISP/hosting provider allows SMTP traffic and does not block port 25

Refer to the [installation guide](../#3-email-server-setup) for more information on how to configure your DNS records and ports.

### 3. Admin app not working via your own reverse proxy

**Symptoms:**
- Errors after logging into the Admin panel
- Page loads but becomes unresponsive
- WebSocket connection errors in browser console

**Solution:**

If you're accessing the Admin page through your own reverse proxy, ensure the Upgrade header is allowed and forwarded. This is required because the Admin app uses WebSockets for client-server communication.

For nginx, add the following to your configuration:

```nginx
# Add WebSocket support for Blazor server
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
proxy_read_timeout 86400;
```

### 4. Forgot VVault admin password

**Solution:**

You can reset the admin password by running the `aliasvault reset-admin-password` command. This will generate a new random password and update the secret.

1. SSH into the aliasvault container:
```bash
docker compose exec -it aliasvault /bin/bash
```

2. Run the reset-admin-password script:
```bash
aliasvault reset-admin-password
```

3. Note the password displayed, then exit the SSH session (`Ctrl+C` or type `exit`) and restart the container:
```bash
docker compose restart
```

4. You can now log in to the admin panel (`/admin`) with the new password.

### 5. Mobile app cannot connect, but web app and browser extension work

The mobile apps enforce certificate trust at the OS level and reject certificates that browsers would accept with a warning. The certificate served by your reverse proxy must be issued by a publicly recognized CA: self-signed certificates, internal CAs, or ones manually added to the device keystore will not work.
